# value-aggregator

The value-aggregator project shows how the ``ValueAggregator.py`` script that ships with OpenMETA can be used to extract values from **Parameters** and **Properties** in the *TopLevelSystemUnderTest*. The Value Aggregator allows for these values to be sampled, summed, counted, averaged, and more. See the [Value Aggregator](http://docs.metamorphsoftware.com/doc/testbenches/testbench_utilities.html#value-aggregator) Documentation for more information.
