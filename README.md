# OpenMETA Examples and Templates

This repository holds a number of different small OpenMETA projects. Some of projects serve as examples of using OpenMETA with some of the integrated domains. Others are examples of common patterns and strategies when using OpenMETA.

The `led-tutorial` and `fea-tutorial` projects are to be used with their respective tutorials in the [OpenMETA documentation](http://docs.metamorphsoftware.com).
