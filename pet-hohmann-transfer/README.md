# Hohmann Transfer Example
This example is based on the Hohmann Transfer orbital mechanics example from NASA's OpenMDAO team. The example is detailed in their documentation:
http://openmdao.org/twodocs/versions/2.2.0/examples/hohmann_transfer/hohmann_transfer.html

This OpenMETA model includes a PET with an optimizer, and uses a combination of Python scripts and Excel spreadsheets to accomplish the calculation. The optimizer works to minimize the total Delta-V.
