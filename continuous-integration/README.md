# continuous-integration

This project shows how an OpenMETA project can be integrated with a Jenkins CI server.

A Jenkins job could be configured to watch for project updates and then execute the commands within the `run_ci_tests.cmd` script to perform regression testing with the various Test Benches and PETs that are included in the project. For more details visit the [Continuous Integration](http://docs.metamorphsoftware.com/doc/utilities/continuousintegrationtest.html) section of the OpenMETA Documentation.
